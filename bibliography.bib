ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Our current understanding of transcription factor binding
                  sites (TFBSs) in sequenced prokaryotic genomes is very limited due
                  to the lack of an accurate and efficient computational method for
                  the prediction of TFBSs at a genome scale. In an attempt to change
                  this situation, we have recently developed a comparative genomics
                  based algorithm called GLECLUBS for de novo genome-wide prediction
                  of TFBSs in a target genome. Although GLECLUBS has achieved rather
                  high prediction accuracy of TFBSs in a target genome, it is still
                  not efficient enough to be applied to all the sequenced prokaryotic
                  genomes.RESULTS:Here, we designed a new algorithm based on GLECLUBS
                  called extended GLECLUBS (eGLECLUBS) for simultaneous prediction of
                  TFBSs in a group of related prokaryotic genomes. When tested on a
                  group of gamma-proteobacterial genomes including E. coli K12, a
                  group of firmicutes genomes including B. subtilis and a group of
                  cyanobacterial genomes using the same parameter settings, eGLECLUBS
                  predicts more than 82% of known TFBSs in extracted inter-operonic
                  sequences in both E. coli K12 and B. subtilis. Because each genome
                  in a group is equally treated, it is highly likely that similar
                  prediction accuracy has been achieved for each genome in the
                  group.CONCLUSIONS:We have developed a new algorithm for genome-wide
                  de novo prediction of TFBSs in a group of related prokaryotic
                  genomes. The algorithm has achieved the same level of accuracy and
                  robustness as its predecessor GLECLUBS, but can work on dozens of
                  genomes at the same time.},

                  capturing, visualization and analysis of predicted transcription
                  factor regulons in prokaryotes that were reconstructed and manually
                  curated by utilizing the comparative genomic approach. A
                  significant number of high-quality inferences of transcriptional
                  regulatory interactions have been already accumulated for diverse
                  taxonomic groups of bacteria. The reconstructed regulons include
                  transcription factors, their cognate DNA motifs and regulated
                  genes/operons linked to the candidate transcription factor binding
                  sites. The RegPrecise allows for browsing the regulon collections
                  for: (i) conservation of DNA binding sites and regulated genes for
                  a particular regulon across diverse taxonomic lineages; (ii) sets
                  of regulons for a family of transcription factors; (iii) repertoire
                  of regulons in a particular taxonomic group of species; (iv)
                  regulons associated with a metabolic pathway or a biological
                  process in various genomes. The initial release of the database
                  includes ∼11 500 candidate binding sites for ∼400 orthologous
                  groups of transcription factors from over 350 prokaryotic
                  genomes. Majority of these data are represented by genome-wide

abstract ={This article summarizes our progress with RegulonDB
                  (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/) during the past 2 years. We have
                  kept up-to-date the knowledge from the published literature
                  regarding transcriptional regulation in Escherichia coli K-12. We
                  have maintained and expanded our curation efforts to improve the
                  breadth and quality of the encoded experimental knowledge, and we
                  have implemented criteria for the quality of our computational
                  predictions. Regulatory phrases now provide high-level descriptions
                  of regulatory regions. We expanded the assignment of quality to
                  various sources of evidence, particularly for knowledge generated
                  through high-throughput (HT) technology. Based on our analysis of
                  most relevant methods, we defined rules for determining the quality
                  of evidence when multiple independent sources support an
                  entry. With this latest release of RegulonDB, we present a new
                  highly reliable larger collection of transcription start sites, a
                  result of our experimental HT genome-wide efforts. These
                  improvements, together with several novel enhancements (the tracks
                  display, uploading format and curational guidelines), address the
                  challenges of incorporating HT-generated knowledge into
                  RegulonDB. Information on the evolutionary conservation of
                  regulatory elements is also available now. Altogether, RegulonDB
                  version 8.0 is a much better home for integrating knowledge on gene
                  regulation from the sources of information currently available.},

abstract ={DBTBS (http://dbtbs.hgc.jp) was originally released in 1999 as a reference
                  database of published transcriptional regulation events in Bacillus
                  subtilis, one of the best studied bacteria. It is essentially a
                  compilation of transcription factors with their regulated genes as
                  well as their recognition sequences, which were experimentally
                  characterized and reported in the literature. Here we report its
                  major update, which contains information on 114 transcription
                  factors, including sigma factors, and 633 promoters of 525
                  genes. The number of references cited in the database has increased
                  from 291 to 378. It also supports a function to find putative
                  transcription factor binding sites within input sequences by using
                  our collection of weight matrices and consensus
                  patterns. Furthermore, though preliminarily, DBTBS now aims to
                  contribute to comparative genomics by showing the presence or
                  absence of potentially orthologous transcription factors and their
                  corresponding cis‐elements on the promoters of their potentially
                  orthologously regulated genes in 50 eubacterial genomes.},

                  with their target sites pose new challenges for TF-binding site
                  databases. CollecTF (http://collectf.umbc.edu) compiles data on
                  experimentally validated, naturally occurring TF-binding sites
                  across the Bacteria domain, placing a strong emphasis on the
                  transparency of the curation process, the quality and availability
                  of the stored data and fully customizable access to its
                  records. CollecTF integrates multiple sources of data automatically
                  and openly, allowing users to dynamically redefine binding motifs
                  and their experimental support base. Data quality and currency are
                  fostered in CollecTF by adopting a sustainable model that
                  encourages direct author submissions in combination with in-house
                  validation and curation of published literature. CollecTF entries
                  are periodically submitted to NCBI for integration into RefSeq
                  complete genome records as link-out features, maximizing the
                  visibility of the data and enriching the annotation of RefSeq files

                  genomics and machine-learning analyses of regulatory interactions,
                  in its initial release CollecTF provides domain-wide coverage of

                  eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Eukaryotes follow a slower rate of
