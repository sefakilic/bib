   Title="{{T}he arginine repressor of {E}scherichia coli}",

   Year="1994",
   Volume="58",
   Number="4",
   Pages="631--640",
   Month="Dec",
   Abstract={This review tells the story of the arginine repressor of
                  Escherichia coli from the time of its discovery in the 1950s
                  until the present. It describes how the research progressed
                  through physiological, genetic, and biochemical phases and
                  how the nature of the repressor and its interaction with its
                  target sites were unraveled. The studies of the repression of
                  arginine biosynthesis revealed unique features at every level
                  of the investigations. In the early phase of the work they
                  showed that the genes controlled by the arginine repressor
                  were scattered over the linkage map and were not united, as
                  in other cases, in a single operon. This led to the concept
                  of the regulon as a physiological unit of regulation. It was
                  also shown that different alleles of the arginine repressor
                  could result in either inhibition of enzyme formation, as in
                  E. coli K-12, or in stimulation of enzyme formation, as in
                  E. coli B. Later it was shown that the arginine repressor is
                  a hexamer, whereas other repressors of biosynthetic pathways
                  are dimers. As a consequence the arginine repressor binds to
                  two palindromic sites rather than to one. It was found that
                  the arginine repressor not only acts in the repression of
                  enzyme synthesis but also is required for the resolution of
                  plasmid multimers to monomers, a completely unrelated
                  function. Finally, the arginine repressor does not possess
                  characteristic structural features seen in other prokaryotic
                  repressors, such as a helix-turn-helix motif or an
                  antiparallel beta-sheet motif. The unique features have
                  sustained continuous interest in the arginine repressor and
                  have made it a challenging subject of investigation.}

   Abstract={In Bacillus subtilis, the AhrC protein represses genes encoding
                  enzymes of arginine biosynthesis and activates those
                  mediating its catabolism. To determine how this repressor
                  also functions as an activator, we attempted to clone
                  catabolic genes by searching for insertions of the Tn917-lacZ
                  transposon that express AhrC-dependent, arginine-inducible
                  beta-galactosidase activity. One such isolate was
                  obtained. The region upstream of lacZ was subcloned in
                  Escherichia coli in such a way that it could be replaced in
                  the B. subtilis chromosome after appropriate
                  manipulation. Analysis of exonuclease III-derived deletions
                  located an AhrC-dependent, arginine-inducible promoter to
                  within a ca. 1.9 kb fragment. The sequence revealed: the 3'
                  end of an ORF homologous to gdh genes encoding glutamate
                  dehydrogenase, with highest homology to the homologue from
                  Clostridium difficile; the 5' end of an ORF homologous to a
                  Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding delta 1-pyrroline
                  5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH), an enzyme of arginine
                  catabolism; and just upstream of the latter, a sequence with
                  homology to known AhrC binding sites in the upstream part of
                  the biosynthetic argCJBD-cpa-F cluster. The same region has
                  also been sequenced by others as part of the B. subtilis
                  genome sequencing project, revealing that the P5CDH gene is
                  the first in a cluster termed rocABC. Restriction fragments
                  containing the putative AhrC-binding sequence, but not those
                  lacking it, showed retarded electrophoretic mobility in the
                  presence of purified AhrC. A 277 bp AhrC-binding fragment
                  also showed anomalous mobility in the absence of AhrC,
                  consistent with its being intrinsically bent. DNAse I
                  footprinting localized AhrC binding to bp -16/-22 to +1 (the
                  transcription startpoint). Such a location for an activator
                  binding site, i.e. overlapping the transcription start, is
                  unusual.}

   Abstract={Recently, the DinR protein was established as the cellular
                  repressor of the SOS response in the bacterium Bacillus
                  subtilis. It is believed that DinR functions as the repressor
                  by binding to a consensus sequence located in the promoter
                  region of each SOS gene. The binding site for DinR is
                  believed to be synonymous with the formerly identified Cheo
                  box, a region of 12 bp displaying dyad symmetry
                  (GAAC-N4-GTTC). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
                  revealed that highly purified DinR does bind to such sites
                  located upstream of the dinA, dinB, dinC, and dinR
                  genes. Furthermore, detailed mutational analysis of the
                  B. subtilis recA operator indicates that some nucleotides are
                  more important than others for maintaining efficient DinR
                  binding. For example, nucleotide substitutions immediately 5'
                  and 3' of the Cheo box as well as those in the N4 region
                  appear to affect DinR binding. This data, combined with
                  computational analyses of potential binding sites in other
                  gram-positive organisms, yields a new consensus (DinR box) of
                  5'-CGAACRNRYGTTYC-3'. DNA footprint analysis of the
                  B. subtilis dinR and recA DinR boxes revealed that the DinR
                  box is centrally located within a DNA region of 31 bp that is
                  protected from hydroxyl radical cleavage in the presence of
                  DinR. Furthermore, while DinR is predominantly monomeric in
                  solution, it apparently binds to the DinR box in a dimeric
                  state.}

                  to specific nucleic acid sequences. They can find a binding
                  site only if the sequence has a recognizable pattern. We
                  define a measure of the information (R sequence) in the
                  sequence patterns at binding sites. It allows one to
                  investigate how information is distributed across the sites
                  and to compare one site to another. One can also calculate
                  the amount of information (R frequency) that would be
                  required to locate the sites, given that they occur with some
                  frequency in the genome. Several Escherichia coli binding
                  sites were analyzed using these two independent empirical
                  measurements. The two amounts of information are similar for
                  most of the sites we analyzed. In contrast, bacteriophage T7
                  RNA polymerase binding sites contain about twice as much
                  information as is necessary for recognition by the T7
                  polymerase, suggesting that a second protein may bind at T7
                  promoters. The extra information can be accounted for by a
                  strong symmetry element found at the T7 promoters. This
                  element may be an operator. If this model is correct, these
                  promoters and operators do not share much information. The
                  comparisons between R sequence and R frequency suggest that
                  the information at binding sites is just sufficient for the
                  sites to be distinguished from the rest of the genome.}

   Abstract={An important step in unravelling the transcriptional regulatory
                  network of an organism is to identify, for each transcription
                  factor, all of its DNA binding sites. Several approaches are
                  commonly used in searching for a transcription factor's
                  binding sites, including consensus sequences and
                  position-specific scoring matrices. In addition, methods that
                  compute the average number of nucleotide matches between a
                  putative site and all known sites can be employed. Such basic
                  approaches can all be naturally extended by incorporating
                  pairwise nucleotide dependencies and per-position information
                  content. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of
                  these basic approaches and their extensions in finding
                  binding sites for a transcription factor of interest without
                  erroneously identifying other genomic sequences.\\ In
                  cross-validation testing on a dataset of Escherichia coli
                  transcription factors and their binding sites, we show that
                  there are statistically significant differences in how well
                  various methods identify transcription factor binding
                  sites. The use of per-position information content improves
                  the performance of all basic approaches. Furthermore,
                  including local pairwise nucleotide dependencies within
                  binding site models results in statistically significant
                  performance improvements for approaches based on nucleotide
                  matches. Based on our analysis, the best results when
                  searching for DNA binding sites of a particular transcription
                  factor are obtained by methods that incorporate both
                  information content and local pairwise correlations.\\ The

                  resistant strains are increasingly being identified
                  worldwide. Here we report the comparison of two newly
                  sequenced genomes of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. The human
                  isolate <italic>A</italic>. <italic>baumannii</italic> AYE is
                  multidrug resistant whereas strain SDF, which was isolated
                  from body lice, is antibiotic susceptible. As reference for
                  comparison in this analysis, the genome of the soil-living
                  bacterium <italic>A. baylyi</italic> strain ADP1 was
                  used. The most interesting dissimilarities we observed were
                  that i) whereas strain AYE and <italic>A. baylyi</italic>
                  genomes harbored very few Insertion Sequence elements which
                  could promote expression of downstream genes, strain SDF
                  sequence contains several hundred of them that have played a
                  crucial role in its genome reduction (gene disruptions and
                  simple DNA loss); ii) strain SDF has low catabolic capacities
                  compared to strain AYE. Interestingly, the latter has even
                  higher catabolic capacities than <italic>A. baylyi</italic>
                  which has already been reported as a very nutritionally
                  versatile organism. This metabolic performance could explain
                  the persistence of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> nosocomial
                  strains in environments where nutrients are scarce;
                  <italic>iii</italic>) several processes known to play a key
                  role during host infection (biofilm formation, iron uptake,
                  quorum sensing, virulence factors) were either different or
                  absent, the best example of which is iron uptake. Indeed,
                  strain AYE and <italic>A. baylyi</italic> use
                  siderophore-based systems to scavenge iron from the
                  environment whereas strain SDF uses an alternate system
                  similar to the Haem Acquisition System (HAS). Taken together,
                  all these observations suggest that the genome contents of
                  the 3 Acinetobacters compared are partly shaped by life in
                  distinct ecological niches: human (and more largely hospital
                  environment), louse, soil.</p>},

                  between translational selection and mutational
                  biases. Current methods for CUB analysis apply heuristics to
                  integrate both components, limiting the depth and scope of
                  CUB analysis as a technique to probe into the evolution and
                  optimization of protein-coding genes. Here we introduce a
                  self-consistent CUB index (scnRCA) that incorporates implicit
                  correction for mutational biases, facilitating exploration of
                  the translational selection component of CUB. We validate
                  this technique using gene expression data and we apply it to
                  a detailed analysis of CUB in the Pseudomonadales. Our
                  results illustrate how the selective enrichment of specific
                  codons among highly expressed genes is preserved in the
                  context of genome-wide shifts in codon frequencies, and how
                  the balance between mutational and translational biases leads
                  to varying definitions of codon optimality. We extend this
                  analysis to other moderate and fast growing bacteria and we
                  provide unified support for the hypothesis that C- and
                  A-ending codons of two-box amino acids, and the U-ending
                  codons of four-box amino acids, are systematically enriched
                  among highly expressed genes across bacteria. The use of an
                  unbiased estimator of CUB allows us to report for the first
                  time that the signature of translational selection is
                  strongly conserved in the Pseudomonadales in spite of drastic
                  changes in genome composition, and extends well beyond the
                  core set of highly optimized genes in each genome. We
                  generalize these results to other moderate and fast growing
                  bacteria, hinting at selection for a universal pattern of
                  gene expression that is conserved and detectable in conserved

abstract ={Motivation:The interaction between transcription factor (TF) and
                  transcription factor binding site (TFBS) is essential for
                  gene regulation. Mutation in either the TF or the TFBS may
                  weaken their interaction and thus result in abnormalities. To
                  maintain such vital interaction, a mutation in one of the
                  interacting partners might be compensated by a corresponding
                  mutation in its binding partner during the course of
                  evolution. Confirming this co-evolutionary relationship will
                  guide us in designing protein sequences to target a specific
                  DNA sequence or in predicting TFBS for poorly studied
                  proteins, or even correcting and rescuing disease mutations
                  in clinical applications.Results: Based on six, publicly
                  available, experimentally validated TF–TFBS binding datasets
                  for the basic Helix–Loop–Helix (bHLH) family, Homeo family,
                  High-Mobility Group (HMG) family and Transient Receptor
                  Potential channels (TRP) family, we showed that the
                  evolutions of the TFs and their TFBSs are significantly
                  correlated across eukaryotes. We further developed a mutual
                  information-based method to identify co-evolved protein
                  residues and DNA bases. This research sheds light on the
                  dynamic relationship between TF and TFBS during their
                  evolution. The same principle and strategy can be applied to
                  co-evolutionary studies on protein–DNA interactions in other
                  protein families.Availability: All the datasets, scripts and

abstract = "The structure of complex transcriptional regulatory networks has
                  been studied extensively in certain model organisms. However,
                  the evolutionary dynamics of these networks across organisms,
                  which would reveal important principles of adaptive
                  regulatory changes, are poorly understood. We use the known
                  transcriptional regulatory network of Escherichia coli to
                  analyse the conservation patterns of this network across 175
                  prokaryotic genomes, and predict components of the regulatory
                  networks for these organisms. We observe that transcription
                  factors are typically less conserved than their target genes
                  and evolve independently of them, with different organisms
                  evolving distinct repertoires of transcription factors
                  responding to specific signals. We show that prokaryotic
                  transcriptional regulatory networks have evolved principally
                  through widespread tinkering of transcriptional interactions
                  at the local level by embedding orthologous genes in
                  different types of regulatory motifs. Different transcription
                  factors have emerged independently as dominant regulatory
                  hubs in various organisms, suggesting that they have
                  convergently acquired similar network structures
                  approximating a scale-free topology. We note that organisms
                  with similar lifestyles across a wide phylogenetic range tend
                  to conserve equivalent interactions and network motifs. Thus,
                  organism-specific optimal network designs appear to have
                  evolved due to selection for specific transcription factors
                  and transcriptional interactions, allowing responses to
                  prevalent environmental stimuli. The methods for biological
                  network analysis introduced here can be applied generally to
                  study other networks, and these predictions can be used to
                  guide specific experiments. "

                  families and have complex evolutionary histories. Here, we
                  ask whether putative orthologs of TFs, from bidirectional
                  best BLAST hits (BBHs), are evolutionary orthologs with
                  conserved functions. We show that BBHs of TFs from distantly

                  the few BBHs that are evolutionary orthologs do have

abstract ={Over millions of years the structure and complexity of the
                  transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) in bacteria has
                  changed, reorganized and enabled them to adapt to almost
                  every environmental niche on earth. In order to understand
                  the plasticity of TRNs in bacteria, we studied the
                  conservation of currently known TRNs of the two model
                  organisms Escherichia coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis across
                  complete genomes including Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya at
                  three different levels: individual components of the TRN,
                  pairs of interactions and regulons. We found that
                  transcription factors (TFs) evolve much faster than the
                  target genes (TGs) across phyla. We show that global
                  regulators are poorly conserved across the phylogenetic
                  spectrum and hence TFs could be the major players responsible
                  for the plasticity and evolvability of the TRNs. We also
                  found that there is only a small fraction of significantly
                  conserved transcriptional regulatory interactions among
                  different phyla of bacteria and that there is no constraint
                  on the elements of the interaction to co-evolve. Finally our
                  results suggest that majority of the regulons in bacteria are
                  rapidly lost implying a high-order flexibility in the
                  TRNs. We hypothesize that during the divergence of bacteria
                  certain essential cellular processes like the synthesis of
                  arginine, biotine and ribose, transport of amino acids and
                  iron, availability of phosphate, replication process and the
                  SOS response are well conserved in evolution. From our
                  comparative analysis, it is possible to infer that
                  transcriptional regulation is more flexible than the genetic
                  component of the organisms and its complexity and structure
                  plays an important role in the phenotypic adaptation.},

abstract ={A transcriptional regulatory network encompasses sets of genes
                  (regulons) whose expression states are directly altered in
                  response to an activating signal, mediated by trans-acting
                  regulatory proteins and cis-acting regulatory
                  sequences. Enumeration of these network components is an
                  essential step toward the creation of a framework for
                  systems-based analysis of biological processes. Profile-based
                  methods for the detection of cis-regulatory elements are
                  often applied to predict regulon members, but they suffer
                  from poor specificity. In this report we describe Regulogger,
                  a novel computational method that uses comparative genomics
                  to eliminate spurious members of predicted gene
                  regulons. Regulogger produces regulogs, sets of coregulated
                  genes for which the regulatory sequence has been conserved
                  across multiple organisms. The quantitative method assigns a
                  confidence score to each predicted regulog member on the
                  basis of the degree of conservation of protein sequence and
                  regulatory mechanisms. When applied to a reference collection
                  of regulons from Escherichia coli, Regulogger increased the
                  specificity of predictions up to 25-fold over methods that
                  use cis-element detection in isolation. The enhanced
                  specificity was observed across a wide range of biologically
                  meaningful parameter combinations, indicating a robust and
                  broad utility for the method. The power of computational
                  pattern discovery methods coupled with Regulogger to unravel
                  transcriptional networks was demonstrated in an analysis of
                  the genome of Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 125 regulogs
                  were found in this organism, including both well-defined
                  functional groups and a subset with unknown functions.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Differences in the transcription regulation network are
                  at the root of much of the phenotypic variation observed
                  among organisms. These differences may be achieved either by
                  changing the repertoire of regulators and/or their targets,
                  or by rewiring the network. Following these changes and
                  studying their logic is crucial for understanding the
                  evolution of regulatory networks.RESULTS:We use the well
                  characterized transcription regulatory network of Escherichia
                  coli K12 and follow the evolutionary changes in the
                  repertoire of regulators and their targets across a large
                  number of fully sequenced gamma-proteobacteria. By focusing
                  on close relatives of E. coli K12, we study the dynamics of
                  the evolution of transcription regulation across a relatively
                  short evolutionary timescale. We show significant differences
                  in the evolution of repressors and activators. Repressors are
                  only lost from a genome once their targets have themselves
                  been lost, or once the network has significantly rewired. In
                  contrast, activators are often lost even when their targets
                  remain in the genome. As a result, E. coli K12 repressors
                  that regulate many targets are rarely absent from organisms
                  that are closely related to E. coli K12, while activators
                  with a similar number of targets are often absent in these
                  organisms.CONCLUSION:We demonstrate that the mode of
                  regulation exerted by transcription factors has a strong
                  effect on their evolution. Repressors co-evolve tightly with
                  their target genes. In contrast, activators can be lost
                  independently of their targets. In fact, loss of an activator
                  can lead to efficient shutdown of an unnecessary pathway.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Integrons are found in hundreds of environmental
                  bacterial species, but are mainly known as the agents
                  responsible for the capture and spread of
                  antibiotic-resistance determinants between Gram-negative
                  pathogens. The SOS response is a regulatory network under
                  control of the repressor protein LexA targeted at addressing
                  DNA damage, thus promoting genetic variation in times of
                  stress. We recently reported a direct link between the SOS
                  response and the expression of integron integrases in Vibrio
                  cholerae and a plasmid-borne class 1 mobile integron. SOS
                  regulation enhances cassette swapping and capture in
                  stressful conditions, while freezing the integron in steady
                  environments. We conducted a systematic study of available
                  integron integrase promoter sequences to analyze the extent
                  of this relationship across the Bacteria domain.RESULTS:Our
                  results showed that LexA controls the expression of a large
                  fraction of integron integrases by binding to Escherichia
                  coli-like LexA binding sites. In addition, the results
                  provide experimental validation of LexA control of the
                  integrase gene for another Vibrio chromosomal integron and
                  for a multiresistance plasmid harboring two integrons. There
                  was a significant correlation between lack of LexA control
                  and predicted inactivation of integrase genes, even though
                  experimental evidence also indicates that LexA regulation may
                  be lost to enhance expression of integron
                  cassettes.CONCLUSIONS:Ancestral-state reconstruction on an
                  integron integrase phylogeny led us to conclude that the
                  ancestral integron was already regulated by LexA. The data
                  also indicated that SOS regulation has been actively
                  preserved in mobile integrons and large chromosomal
                  integrons, suggesting that unregulated integrase activity is
                  selected against. Nonetheless, additional adaptations have
                  probably arisen to cope with unregulated integrase
                  activity. Identifying them may be fundamental in deciphering
                  the uneven distribution of integrons in the Bacteria
                  domain.},

   Abstract={The availability of completely sequenced genomes and the wealth of
                  literature on gene regulation have enabled researchers to
                  model the transcriptional regulation system of some organisms
                  in the form of a network. In order to reconstruct such
                  networks in non-model organisms, three principal approaches
                  have been taken. First, one can transfer the interactions
                  between homologous components from a model organism to the
                  organism of interest. Second, microarray experiments can be
                  used to detect patterns in gene expression that stem from
                  regulatory interactions. Finally, knowledge of experimentally
                  characterized transcription factor binding sites can be used
                  to analyze the promoter sequences in a genome in order to
                  identify potential binding sites. In this chapter, we will
                  focus in detail on the first approach and describe methods to
                  reconstruct and analyze the transcriptional regulatory
                  networks of uncharacterized organisms by using a known
                  regulatory network as a template.}

                  very limited due to the lack of an accurate and efficient
                  computational method for the prediction of TFBSs at a genome
                  scale. In an attempt to change this situation, we have
                  recently developed a comparative genomics based algorithm
                  called GLECLUBS for de novo genome-wide prediction of TFBSs
                  in a target genome. Although GLECLUBS has achieved rather
                  high prediction accuracy of TFBSs in a target genome, it is
                  still not efficient enough to be applied to all the sequenced
                  prokaryotic genomes.RESULTS:Here, we designed a new algorithm
                  based on GLECLUBS called extended GLECLUBS (eGLECLUBS) for
                  simultaneous prediction of TFBSs in a group of related
                  prokaryotic genomes. When tested on a group of
                  gamma-proteobacterial genomes including E. coli K12, a group
                  of firmicutes genomes including B. subtilis and a group of
                  cyanobacterial genomes using the same parameter settings,
                  eGLECLUBS predicts more than 82% of known TFBSs in extracted
                  inter-operonic sequences in both E. coli K12 and
                  B. subtilis. Because each genome in a group is equally
                  treated, it is highly likely that similar prediction accuracy
                  has been achieved for each genome in the group.CONCLUSIONS:We
                  have developed a new algorithm for genome-wide de novo
                  prediction of TFBSs in a group of related prokaryotic
                  genomes. The algorithm has achieved the same level of
                  accuracy and robustness as its predecessor GLECLUBS, but can
                  work on dozens of genomes at the same time.},

                  for capturing, visualization and analysis of predicted
                  transcription factor regulons in prokaryotes that were
                  reconstructed and manually curated by utilizing the
                  comparative genomic approach. A significant number of
                  high-quality inferences of transcriptional regulatory
                  interactions have been already accumulated for diverse
                  taxonomic groups of bacteria. The reconstructed regulons
                  include transcription factors, their cognate DNA motifs and
                  regulated genes/operons linked to the candidate transcription
                  factor binding sites. The RegPrecise allows for browsing the
                  regulon collections for: (i) conservation of DNA binding
                  sites and regulated genes for a particular regulon across
                  diverse taxonomic lineages; (ii) sets of regulons for a
                  family of transcription factors; (iii) repertoire of regulons
                  in a particular taxonomic group of species; (iv) regulons
                  associated with a metabolic pathway or a biological process
                  in various genomes. The initial release of the database
                  includes ∼11 500 candidate binding sites for ∼400 orthologous
                  groups of transcription factors from over 350 prokaryotic
                  genomes. Majority of these data are represented by
                  genome-wide regulon reconstructions in Shewanella and
                  Streptococcus genera and a large-scale prediction of regulons
                  for the LacI family of transcription factors. Another section
                  in the database represents the results of accurate regulon
                  propagation to the closely related genomes.},

abstract ={This article summarizes our progress with RegulonDB
                  (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/) during the past 2 years. We
                  have kept up-to-date the knowledge from the published
                  literature regarding transcriptional regulation in
                  Escherichia coli K-12. We have maintained and expanded our
                  curation efforts to improve the breadth and quality of the
                  encoded experimental knowledge, and we have implemented
                  criteria for the quality of our computational
                  predictions. Regulatory phrases now provide high-level
                  descriptions of regulatory regions. We expanded the
                  assignment of quality to various sources of evidence,
                  particularly for knowledge generated through high-throughput
                  (HT) technology. Based on our analysis of most relevant
                  methods, we defined rules for determining the quality of
                  evidence when multiple independent sources support an
                  entry. With this latest release of RegulonDB, we present a
                  new highly reliable larger collection of transcription start
                  sites, a result of our experimental HT genome-wide
                  efforts. These improvements, together with several novel
                  enhancements (the tracks display, uploading format and
                  curational guidelines), address the challenges of
                  incorporating HT-generated knowledge into
                  RegulonDB. Information on the evolutionary conservation of
                  regulatory elements is also available now. Altogether,
                  RegulonDB version 8.0 is a much better home for integrating
                  knowledge on gene regulation from the sources of information
                  currently available.},

                  factors with their regulated genes as well as their
                  recognition sequences, which were experimentally
                  characterized and reported in the literature. Here we report
                  its major update, which contains information on 114
                  transcription factors, including sigma factors, and 633
                  promoters of 525 genes. The number of references cited in the

                  transparency of the curation process, the quality and
                  availability of the stored data and fully customizable access
                  to its records. CollecTF integrates multiple sources of data
                  automatically and openly, allowing users to dynamically
                  redefine binding motifs and their experimental support
                  base. Data quality and currency are fostered in CollecTF by
                  adopting a sustainable model that encourages direct author
                  submissions in combination with in-house validation and
                  curation of published literature. CollecTF entries are
                  periodically submitted to NCBI for integration into RefSeq
                  complete genome records as link-out features, maximizing the
                  visibility of the data and enriching the annotation of RefSeq
                  files with regulatory information. Seeking to facilitate
                  comparative genomics and machine-learning analyses of
                  regulatory interactions, in its initial release CollecTF
                  provides domain-wide coverage of two TF families (LexA and
                  Fur), as well as extensive representation for a clinically
                  important bacterial family, the Vibrionaceae.},

                  gene regulatory interactions. The latter are genetic
                  mechanisms that control a cell's characteristics, for
                  instance, pathogenicity as well as survival and reproduction
                  strategies. CoryneRegNet is the reference database and
                  analysis platform for corynebacterial gene regulatory
                  networks. In this article we introduce the updated version
                  6.0 of CoryneRegNet and describe the updated database content
                  which includes, 6352 corynebacterial regulatory interactions

                  regulations in release 4.0, respectively. We also demonstrate
                  how we support the community by integrating analysis and
                  visualization features for transiently imported custom data,
                  such as gene regulatory interactions. Furthermore, with
                  release 6.0, we provide easy-to-use functions that allow the
                  user to submit data for persistent storage with the
                  CoryneRegNet database. Thus, it offers important options to

                  increased from 150 in the initial version of DBD to over 700
                  in the current version. All predicted TFs must contain a
                  significant match to a hidden Markov model representing a
                  sequence-specific DNA-binding domain family. Access to TF
                  predictions is provided through
                  http://transcriptionfactor.org, where new search options are

                  the clear partition between eukaryotic and prokaryotic DBD

                  in number of predicted TFs with proteome size in eukaryotes
                  and prokaryotes. Eukaryotes follow a slower rate of increase
                  in TFs than prokaryotes, which could be due to the presence
                  of splice variants or an increase in combinatorial control.

abstract ={STAMP is a newly developed web server that is designed to support
                  the study of DNA-binding motifs. STAMP may be used to query
                  motifs against databases of known motifs; the software aligns
                  input motifs against the chosen database (or alternatively
                  against a user-provided dataset), and lists of the
                  highest-scoring matches are returned. Such similarity-search
                  functionality is expected to facilitate the identification of
                  transcription factors that potentially interact with newly
                  discovered motifs. STAMP also automatically builds multiple
                  alignments, familial binding profiles and similarity trees
                  when more than one motif is inputted. These functions are
                  expected to enable evolutionary studies on sets of related
                  motifs and fixed-order regulatory modules, as well as
                  illustrating similarities and redundancies within the input
                  motif collection. STAMP is a highly flexible alignment
                  platform, allowing users to ‘mix-and-match’ between various
                  implemented comparison metrics, alignment methods (local or
                  global, gapped or ungapped), multiple alignment strategies
                  and tree-building methods. Motifs may be inputted as
                  frequency matrices (in many of the commonly used formats),
                  consensus sequences, or alignments of known binding
                  sites. STAMP also directly accepts the output files from 12
                  supported motif-finders, enabling quick interpretation of
                  motif-discovery analyses. STAMP is available at

                  that DNA was the genetic material it became apparent that
                  organisms, and in particular bacteria, use the four letters
                  of the genetic code to very different extents; the use of G
                  and C varies from less than 20% in some species, to more than
                  70% in others. This variation in the use of G and C is
                  usually attributed to differences in the pattern of mutation
                  between species. Here we test this hypothesis, and show that,
                  on the contrary, there seems to be pervasive selection on the
                  base composition of the bacterial genome, particularly in
                  GC-rich species. This suggests that many, if not all, sites
                  may be subject to natural selection in many
                  bacteria. Unfortunately, the reason why some bacteria should

                  through the variability generated by mutation and biases
                  evolution toward fitter outcomes. However, because mutation
                  is itself not entirely random it can also bias the direction
                  of evolution independently of selection. For instance, it is
                  often assumed that the extreme variation observed in
                  nucleotide content among bacteria (from ∼20% to ∼80% GC) is
                  predominantly driven by extreme differences in mutational
                  biases towards or away from GC. Here, we show that bacterial
                  lineages that recently developed clonal, pathogenic
                  lifestyles evolve under weak selection and that polymorphisms
                  in these bacteria can be used as a fair proxy for mutational
                  spectra. We analyze large sequence datasets from five clonal
                  pathogens in four diverse bacterial clades spanning most of
                  the range of genomic nucleotide content. We find that,
                  surprisingly, mutation is AT-biased in every case to a very
                  similar degree and in each case it is dominated by
                  transitions from C/G to T/A. This demonstrates that
                  mutational biases are far les variable than previously
                  assumed and that variation in bacterial nucleotide content is
                  not due entirely to mutational biases. Rather natural
                  selection or a selection like process such as biased gene
                  conversion strongly affect nucleotide content in

abstract ={Given the dramatic variation in guanine-cytosine (GC) content
                  observed in prokaryotes, from ∼20% to ∼75% GC, one wonders if
                  these extreme biases in base pair composition affect the
                  evolution of transcription factor–binding sites (BS). This
                  letter shows that, along the wide range of GC content
                  variation in bacteria, bacterial BS keep a high frequency of
                  AT bases, roughly independently of the background (BG) base
                  pair composition of intergenic regions. As a result, the
                  equilibrium base pair frequencies of BS depart the most from
                  those of BS DNA in GC-rich genomes. This not only implies a
                  higher specificity but also a higher coding barrier for BS in

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Searching for transcription factor binding sites in
                  genome sequences is still an open problem in
                  bioinformatics. Despite substantial progress, search methods
                  based on information theory remain a standard in the field,
                  even though the full validity of their underlying assumptions
                  has only been tested in artificial settings. Here we use
                  newly available data on transcription factors from different
                  bacterial genomes to make a more thorough assessment of
                  information theory-based search methods.RESULTS:Our results
                  reveal that conventional benchmarking against artificial
                  sequence data leads frequently to overestimation of search
                  efficiency. In addition, we find that sequence information by
                  itself is often inadequate and therefore must be complemented
                  by other cues, such as curvature, in real
                  genomes. Furthermore, results on skewed genomes show that
                  methods integrating skew information, such as Relative
                  Entropy, are not effective because their assumptions may not
                  hold in real genomes. The evidence suggests that binding
                  sites tend to evolve towards genomic skew, rather than
                  against it, and to maintain their information content through
                  increased conservation. Based on these results, we identify
                  several misconceptions on information theory as applied to
                  binding sites, such as negative entropy, and we propose a
                  revised paradigm to explain the observed
                  results.CONCLUSION:We conclude that, among information
                  theory-based methods, the most unassuming search methods
                  perform, on average, better than any other alternatives,
                  since heuristic corrections to these methods are prone to
                  fail when working on real data. A reexamination of
                  information content in binding sites reveals that information
                  content is a compound measure of search and binding affinity
                  requirements, a fact that has important repercussions for our
                  understanding of binding site evolution.},

   Abstract={The similarity of two biological sequences has traditionally been
                  assessed within the well-established framework of
                  alignment. Here we focus on the task of identifying
                  functional relationships between cis-regulatory sequences
                  that are non-orthologous or greatly
                  diverged. 'Alignment-free' measures of sequence similarity
                  are required in this regime.\\ We investigate the use of a
                  new score for alignment-free sequence comparison, called the
                  score. It is based on comparing the frequencies of all
                  fixed-length words in the two sequences. An important, novel
                  feature of the score is that it is comparable across sequence
                  pairs drawn from arbitrary background distributions. We
                  present a method that gives quadratic improvement in the time
                  complexity of calculating the score, over the naïve
                  method. We then evaluate the score on several tissue-specific
                  families of cis-regulatory modules (in Drosophila and
                  human). The new score is highly successful in discriminating
                  functionally related regulatory sequences from unrelated
                  sequence pairs. The performance of the score is compared to
                  five other alignment-free similarity measures, and shown to
                  be consistently superior to all of these measures.\\ Our
                  implementation of the score will be made freely available as
                  source code, upon publication of this article, at:

   Abstract={In contrast to the vast majority of the members of the domain
                  Bacteria, several Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas species have
                  two lexA genes, whose products have been shown to recognize
                  different LexA binding motifs, making them an interesting
                  target for studying the interplay between cohabiting LexA
                  regulons in a single species. Here we report an analysis of
                  the genetic composition of the two LexA regulons of
                  Pseudomonas putida KT2440 performed with a genomic
                  microarray. The data obtained indicate that one of the two
                  LexA proteins (LexA1) seems to be in control of the
                  conventional Escherichia coli-like SOS response, while the
                  other LexA protein (LexA2) regulates only its own
                  transcriptional unit, which includes the imuA, imuB, and
                  dnaE2 genes, and a gene (PP_3901) from a resident P. putida
                  prophage. Furthermore, PP_3901 is also regulated by LexA1 and
                  is required for DNA damage-mediated induction of several
                  P. putida resident prophage genes. In silico searches
                  suggested that this marked asymmetry in regulon contents also
                  occurs in other Pseudomonas species with two lexA genes, and
                  the implications of this asymmetry in the evolution of the
                  SOS network are discussed.}

                  is found in a wide variety of environments and must monitor
                  and respond to various environmental signals such as the
                  availability of iron, an essential element for bacterial
                  growth. An important regulator of iron homeostasis is Fur
                  (ferric uptake regulator), and here we present the first
                  study of the Fur regulon in DC3000. Using chromatin
                  immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing
                  (ChIP-seq), 312 chromosomal regions were highly enriched by
                  coimmunoprecipitation with a C-terminally tagged Fur
                  protein. Integration of these data with previous microarray
                  and global transcriptome analyses allowed us to expand the

                  of Pseudomonas syringae, including P. syringae pv. tomato
                  DC3000, which is pathogenic on crucifers and tomato, and
                  P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180, a soybean pathogen. The COR
                  molecule contains two distinct components, coronafacic acid
                  (CFA) and coronamic acid (CMA), which are intermediates in
                  the COR biosynthetic pathway. In P. syringae pv. tomato
                  DC3000, it is not clear whether corR, which encodes a
                  response regulator, positively regulates CFA and CMA
                  synthesis as it does in P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180. In
                  this study, a corR mutant of P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000
                  was constructed and was shown to be defective in the
                  production of COR, CFA, and CMA. Furthermore, disease
                  severity was greatly reduced in tomato plants inoculated with
                  the corR mutant compared with wild-type P. syringae
                  pv. tomato DC3000. We also showed that a mutation in hrpL,
                  which encodes an alternate RNA polymerase sigma factor
                  (sigmaL) required for the expression of genes encoding
                  components of the type III secretion system, abrogated
                  production of COR in P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000. The
                  presence of a potential hrp box, the recognition site for
                  sigmaL, upstream of corR suggested that corR might be
                  regulated by hrpL. This was confirmed in
                  reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments
                  showing that the upstream effector gene holPtoAA, which was
                  associated with the hrp box, was cotranscribed with
                  corR. Furthermore, studies also were conducted to investigate
                  whether mutations in corR had effects on the expression of
                  hrpL. The corR mutant of P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 showed
                  both a reduction and delay in the expression of hrpL and was
                  impaired in its ability to elicit a hypersensitive response
                  on Nicotiana benthamiana. A putative CorR-binding site was
                  identified upstream of hrpL, and gel shift studies confirmed
                  the binding of CorR to this region. These results indicate
                  that corR directly impacts the expression of the hrp regulon
                  in P. syringae.}

   Abstract={Pseudomonas putida is a soil microorganism that utilizes aromatic
                  amino acids present in root exudates as a nitrogen source. We
                  have previously shown that the PhhR transcriptional regulator
                  induces phhAB genes encoding a phenylalanine hydroxylase. In
                  this study we show, using microarray assays and promoter
                  fusions, that PhhR is a global regulator responsible for the
                  activation of genes essential for phenylalanine degradation,
                  phenylalanine homeostasis and other genes of unknown
                  function. Recently, it has been shown that phenylalanine
                  catabolism occurs through more than one pathway. One of these
                  possible pathways involves the metabolism of phenylalanine
                  via tyrosine, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, and homogentisate. We
                  identified two genes within this pathway that encode an
                  acyl-CoA transferase involved in the metabolism of
                  acetoacetate. All genes in this pathway were induced in
                  response to phenylalanine in a PhhR-proficient
                  background. The second potential degradative pathway involves
                  the degradation of phenylalanine to produce phenylpyruvate,
                  which seems to be degraded via phenylacetyl-CoA. A number of
                  mutants in the paa genes encoding phenylacetyl-CoA
                  degradation enzymes fail to grow on phenylpyruvate or
                  phenylacetate, further supporting the existence of this
                  second pathway. We found that the PhhR regulon also includes
                  genes involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids
                  that are repressed in the presence of phenylalanine,
                  suggesting the possibility of feedback at the transcriptional
                  level. In addition, we found that PhhR modulates the level of
                  expression of the broad-substrate-specificity MexEF/OprN
                  efflux pump. Expression from this pump is under the control
                  of mexT gene product because phenylalanine-dependent
                  transcription from the mexE promoter does not occur in a mexT
                  mutant background. These results place PhhR as an important
                  regulator in the control of bacterial responses to aromatic
                  amino acids.}

   Abstract={The plant cell wall, which consists of a highly complex array of
                  interconnecting polysaccharides, is the most abundant source
                  of organic carbon in the biosphere. Microorganisms that
                  degrade the plant cell wall synthesize an extensive portfolio
                  of hydrolytic enzymes that display highly complex molecular
                  architectures. To unravel the intricate repertoire of plant
                  cell wall-degrading enzymes synthesized by the saprophytic
                  soil bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus, we sequenced and
                  analyzed its genome, which predicts that the bacterium
                  contains the complete repertoire of enzymes required to
                  degrade plant cell wall and storage
                  polysaccharides. Approximately one-third of these putative
                  proteins (57) are predicted to contain carbohydrate binding
                  modules derived from 13 of the 49 known families. Sequence
                  analysis reveals approximately 130 predicted glycoside
                  hydrolases that target the major structural and storage plant
                  polysaccharides. In common with that of the colonic
                  prokaryote Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, the genome of
                  C. japonicus is predicted to encode a large number of GH43
                  enzymes, suggesting that the extensive arabinose decorations
                  appended to pectins and xylans may represent a major nutrient
                  source, not just for intestinal bacteria but also for
                  microorganisms that occupy terrestrial ecosystems. The
                  results presented here predict that C. japonicus possesses an
                  extensive range of glycoside hydrolases, lyases, and
                  esterases. Most importantly, the genome of C. japonicus is
                  remarkably similar to that of the gram-negative marine
                  bacterium, Saccharophagus degradans 2-40(T). Approximately
                  50% of the predicted C. japonicus plant-degradative apparatus
                  appears to be shared with S. degradans, consistent with the
                  utilization of plant-derived complex carbohydrates as a major
                  substrate by both organisms.}

                  importance, relatively little is known about how microbes
                  degrade plant cell walls. Much of this gap in knowledge has
                  resulted from difficulties in extending modern molecular
                  tools to the study of plant cell wall-degrading microbes. The
                  bacterium Cellvibrio japonicus has recently emerged as a
                  powerful model system for the study of microbial plant cell
                  wall degradation. C. japonicus is unique among microbial
                  model systems in that it possesses the ability to carry out
                  the complete degradation of plant cell wall
                  polysaccharides. Furthermore, an extensive array of genetic
                  and molecular tools exists for functional genomic
                  analysis. In this review, we describe progress in the
                  development of methodology for the functional genomic study
                  of plant cell wall degradation by this microbe, and discuss
                  future directions for research.}

   Title="{{C}ombinatorial gene regulation using auto-regulation}",
   Journal="PLoS Comput. Biol.",
   Year="2010",
   Volume="6",
   Number="6",
   Pages="e1000813",
   Month="Jun",
   Abstract={As many as 59\% of the transcription factors in Escherichia coli
                  regulate the transcription rate of their own genes. This
                  suggests that auto-regulation has one or more important
                  functions. Here, one possible function is studied. Often the
                  transcription rate of an auto-regulator is also controlled by
                  additional transcription factors. In these cases, the way the
                  expression of the auto-regulator responds to changes in the
                  concentrations of the "input" regulators (the response
                  function) is obviously affected by the auto-regulation. We
                  suggest that, conversely, auto-regulation may be used to
                  optimize this response function. To test this hypothesis, we
                  use an evolutionary algorithm and a chemical-physical model
                  of transcription regulation to design model cis-regulatory
                  constructs with predefined response functions. In these
                  simulations, auto-regulation can evolve if this provides a
                  functional benefit. When selecting for a series of elementary
                  response functions-Boolean logic gates and linear
                  responses-the cis-regulatory regions resulting from the
                  simulations indeed often exploit
                  auto-regulation. Surprisingly, the resulting constructs use
                  auto-activation rather than auto-repression. Several design
                  principles show up repeatedly in the simulation results. They
                  demonstrate how auto-activation can be used to generate
                  sharp, switch-like activation and repression circuits and how
                  linearly decreasing response functions can be
                  obtained. Auto-repression, on the other hand, resulted only
                  when a high response speed or a suppression of intrinsic
                  noise was also selected for. The results suggest that, while
                  auto-repression may primarily be valuable to improve the
                  dynamical properties of regulatory circuits, auto-activation
                  is likely to evolve even when selection acts on the shape of
                  response function only.}

                  simple transcriptional regulatory networks can be exploited
                  to infer regulatory motifs from the growing amounts of
                  genomic and meta-genomic data. These motifs can in principle
                  be used to elucidate the nature and scope of transcriptional
                  networks through comparative genomics. Here we assess the
                  feasibility of this approach using the SOS regulatory network
                  of Gram-positive bacteria as a test case. Using
                  experimentally validated data, we show that the known
                  regulatory motif can be inferred through the assumption of
                  self-regulation. Furthermore, the inferred motif provides a
                  more robust search pattern for comparative genomics than the
                  experimental motifs defined in reference organisms. We take
                  advantage of this robustness to generate a functional map of
                  the SOS response in Gram-positive bacteria. Our results
                  reveal definite differences in the composition of the LexA
                  regulon between Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and confirm
                  that regulation of cell-division inhibition is a widespread
                  characteristic of this network among Gram-positive bacteria.}

   Abstract={Recent advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) have
                  enabled tremendous leaps forward in our understanding of
                  bacterial transcriptomes. However, computational methods for
                  analysis of bacterial transcriptome data have not kept pace
                  with the large and growing data sets generated by RNA-seq
                  technology. Here, we present new algorithms, specific to
                  bacterial gene structures and transcriptomes, for analysis of
                  RNA-seq data. The algorithms are implemented in an open
                  source software system called Rockhopper that supports
                  various stages of bacterial RNA-seq data analysis, including
                  aligning sequencing reads to a genome, constructing
                  transcriptome maps, quantifying transcript abundance, testing
                  for differential gene expression, determining operon
                  structures and visualizing results. We demonstrate the
                  performance of Rockhopper using 2.1 billion sequenced reads
                  from 75 RNA-seq experiments conducted with Escherichia coli,
                  Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus
                  pyogenes and Xenorhabdus nematophila. We find that the
                  transcriptome maps generated by our algorithms are highly
                  accurate when compared with focused experimental data from
                  E. coli and N. gonorrhoeae, and we validate our system's
                  ability to identify novel small RNAs, operons and
                  transcription start sites. Our results suggest that
                  Rockhopper can be used for efficient and accurate analysis of
                  bacterial RNA-seq data, and that it can aid with elucidation
                  of bacterial transcriptomes.}
