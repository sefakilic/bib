    abstract = {Codon usage bias (CUB) results from the complex interplay
                  between translational selection and mutational biases. Current
                  methods for CUB analysis apply heuristics to integrate both
                  components, limiting the depth and scope of CUB analysis as a
                  technique to probe into the evolution and optimization of
                  protein-coding genes. Here we introduce a self-consistent CUB
                  index (scnRCA) that incorporates implicit correction for
                  mutational biases, facilitating exploration of the
                  translational selection component of CUB. We validate this
                  technique using gene expression data and we apply it to a
                  detailed analysis of CUB in the Pseudomonadales. Our results
                  illustrate how the selective enrichment of specific codons
                  among highly expressed genes is preserved in the context of
                  genome-wide shifts in codon frequencies, and how the balance
                  between mutational and translational biases leads to varying
                  definitions of codon optimality. We extend this analysis to
                  other moderate and fast growing bacteria and we provide
                  unified support for the hypothesis that C- and A-ending codons
                  of two-box amino acids, and the U-ending codons of four-box
                  amino acids, are systematically enriched among highly
                  expressed genes across bacteria. The use of an unbiased
                  estimator of CUB allows us to report for the first time that
                  the signature of translational selection is strongly conserved
                  in the Pseudomonadales in spite of drastic changes in genome
                  composition, and extends well beyond the core set of highly
                  optimized genes in each genome. We generalize these results to
                  other moderate and fast growing bacteria, hinting at selection
                  for a universal pattern of gene expression that is conserved
                  and detectable in conserved patterns of codon usage bias.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Our current understanding of transcription factor binding
                  sites (TFBSs) in sequenced prokaryotic genomes is very limited due
                  to the lack of an accurate and efficient computational method for
                  the prediction of TFBSs at a genome scale. In an attempt to change
                  this situation, we have recently developed a comparative genomics
                  based algorithm called GLECLUBS for de novo genome-wide prediction
                  of TFBSs in a target genome. Although GLECLUBS has achieved rather
                  high prediction accuracy of TFBSs in a target genome, it is still
                  not efficient enough to be applied to all the sequenced prokaryotic
                  genomes.RESULTS:Here, we designed a new algorithm based on GLECLUBS
                  called extended GLECLUBS (eGLECLUBS) for simultaneous prediction of
                  TFBSs in a group of related prokaryotic genomes. When tested on a
                  group of gamma-proteobacterial genomes including E. coli K12, a
                  group of firmicutes genomes including B. subtilis and a group of
                  cyanobacterial genomes using the same parameter settings, eGLECLUBS
                  predicts more than 82% of known TFBSs in extracted inter-operonic
                  sequences in both E. coli K12 and B. subtilis. Because each genome
                  in a group is equally treated, it is highly likely that similar
                  prediction accuracy has been achieved for each genome in the
                  group.CONCLUSIONS:We have developed a new algorithm for genome-wide
                  de novo prediction of TFBSs in a group of related prokaryotic
                  genomes. The algorithm has achieved the same level of accuracy and
                  robustness as its predecessor GLECLUBS, but can work on dozens of
                  genomes at the same time.},

                  curated by utilizing the comparative genomic approach. A
                  significant number of high-quality inferences of transcriptional
                  regulatory interactions have been already accumulated for diverse
                  taxonomic groups of bacteria. The reconstructed regulons include
                  transcription factors, their cognate DNA motifs and regulated
                  genes/operons linked to the candidate transcription factor binding
                  sites. The RegPrecise allows for browsing the regulon collections
                  for: (i) conservation of DNA binding sites and regulated genes for
                  a particular regulon across diverse taxonomic lineages; (ii) sets
                  of regulons for a family of transcription factors; (iii) repertoire
                  of regulons in a particular taxonomic group of species; (iv)
                  regulons associated with a metabolic pathway or a biological
                  process in various genomes. The initial release of the database
                  includes ∼11 500 candidate binding sites for ∼400 orthologous
                  groups of transcription factors from over 350 prokaryotic
                  genomes. Majority of these data are represented by genome-wide

                  (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/) during the past 2 years. We have
                  kept up-to-date the knowledge from the published literature
                  regarding transcriptional regulation in Escherichia coli K-12. We
                  have maintained and expanded our curation efforts to improve the
                  breadth and quality of the encoded experimental knowledge, and we
                  have implemented criteria for the quality of our computational
                  predictions. Regulatory phrases now provide high-level descriptions
                  of regulatory regions. We expanded the assignment of quality to
                  various sources of evidence, particularly for knowledge generated
                  through high-throughput (HT) technology. Based on our analysis of
                  most relevant methods, we defined rules for determining the quality
                  of evidence when multiple independent sources support an
                  entry. With this latest release of RegulonDB, we present a new
                  highly reliable larger collection of transcription start sites, a
                  result of our experimental HT genome-wide efforts. These
                  improvements, together with several novel enhancements (the tracks
                  display, uploading format and curational guidelines), address the
                  challenges of incorporating HT-generated knowledge into
                  RegulonDB. Information on the evolutionary conservation of
                  regulatory elements is also available now. Altogether, RegulonDB
                  version 8.0 is a much better home for integrating knowledge on gene
                  regulation from the sources of information currently available.},

                  database of published transcriptional regulation events in Bacillus
                  subtilis, one of the best studied bacteria. It is essentially a
                  compilation of transcription factors with their regulated genes as
                  well as their recognition sequences, which were experimentally
                  characterized and reported in the literature. Here we report its
                  major update, which contains information on 114 transcription
                  factors, including sigma factors, and 633 promoters of 525
                  genes. The number of references cited in the database has increased
                  from 291 to 378. It also supports a function to find putative
                  transcription factor binding sites within input sequences by using
                  our collection of weight matrices and consensus

abstract ={The influx of high-throughput data and the need for complex models to
                  describe the interaction of prokaryotic transcription factors (TF)
                  with their target sites pose new challenges for TF-binding site
                  databases. CollecTF (http://collectf.umbc.edu) compiles data on
                  experimentally validated, naturally occurring TF-binding sites
                  across the Bacteria domain, placing a strong emphasis on the
                  transparency of the curation process, the quality and availability
                  of the stored data and fully customizable access to its
                  records. CollecTF integrates multiple sources of data automatically
                  and openly, allowing users to dynamically redefine binding motifs
                  and their experimental support base. Data quality and currency are
                  fostered in CollecTF by adopting a sustainable model that
                  encourages direct author submissions in combination with in-house
                  validation and curation of published literature. CollecTF entries
                  are periodically submitted to NCBI for integration into RefSeq
                  complete genome records as link-out features, maximizing the
                  visibility of the data and enriching the annotation of RefSeq files
                  with regulatory information. Seeking to facilitate comparative
                  genomics and machine-learning analyses of regulatory interactions,
                  in its initial release CollecTF provides domain-wide coverage of
                  two TF families (LexA and Fur), as well as extensive representation
                  for a clinically important bacterial family, the Vibrionaceae.},

abstract = {DNA-binding domain (DBD) is a database of predicted sequence-specific
                  DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) for all publicly available
                  proteomes. The proteomes have increased from 150 in the initial
                  version of DBD to over 700 in the current version. All predicted
                  TFs must contain a significant match to a hidden Markov model
                  representing a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain family. Access
                  to TF predictions is provided through
                  http://transcriptionfactor.org, where new search options are now
                  provided such as searching by gene names in model organisms,
                  searching for all proteins in a particular DBD family and specific
                  organism. We illustrate the application of this type of search
                  facility by contrasting trends of DBD family occurrence throughout
                  the tree of life, highlighting the clear partition between
                  eukaryotic and prokaryotic DBD expansions. The website content has
                  been expanded to include dedicated pages for each TF containing
                  domain assignment details, gene names, links to external databases
                  and links to TFs with similar domain arrangements. We compare the
                  increase in number of predicted TFs with proteome size in
                  eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Eukaryotes follow a slower rate of
                  increase in TFs than prokaryotes, which could be due to the
                  presence of splice variants or an increase in combinatorial
                  control.  },

abstract ={STAMP is a newly developed web server that is designed to support the
                  study of DNA-binding motifs. STAMP may be used to query motifs
                  against databases of known motifs; the software aligns input
                  motifs against the chosen database (or alternatively against a
                  user-provided dataset), and lists of the highest-scoring
                  matches are returned. Such similarity-search functionality is
                  expected to facilitate the identification of transcription
                  factors that potentially interact with newly discovered
                  motifs. STAMP also automatically builds multiple alignments,
                  familial binding profiles and similarity trees when more than
                  one motif is inputted. These functions are expected to enable
                  evolutionary studies on sets of related motifs and fixed-order
                  regulatory modules, as well as illustrating similarities and
                  redundancies within the input motif collection. STAMP is a
                  highly flexible alignment platform, allowing users to
                  ‘mix-and-match’ between various implemented comparison
                  metrics, alignment methods (local or global, gapped or
                  ungapped), multiple alignment strategies and tree-building
                  methods. Motifs may be inputted as frequency matrices (in many
                  of the commonly used formats), consensus sequences, or
                  alignments of known binding sites. STAMP also directly accepts
                  the output files from 12 supported motif-finders, enabling
                  quick interpretation of motif-discovery analyses. STAMP is
                  available at http://www.benoslab.pitt.edu/stamp},
