   Title="{{T}he arginine repressor of {E}scherichia coli}",

   Volume="58",
   Number="4",

   Month="Dec",
   Abstract={This review tells the story of the arginine repressor of
                  Escherichia coli from the time of its discovery in the 1950s
                  until the present. It describes how the research progressed
                  through physiological, genetic, and biochemical phases and how
                  the nature of the repressor and its interaction with its
                  target sites were unraveled. The studies of the repression of
                  arginine biosynthesis revealed unique features at every level
                  of the investigations. In the early phase of the work they
                  showed that the genes controlled by the arginine repressor
                  were scattered over the linkage map and were not united, as in
                  other cases, in a single operon. This led to the concept of
                  the regulon as a physiological unit of regulation. It was also
                  shown that different alleles of the arginine repressor could
                  result in either inhibition of enzyme formation, as in E. coli
                  K-12, or in stimulation of enzyme formation, as in E. coli
                  B. Later it was shown that the arginine repressor is a
                  hexamer, whereas other repressors of biosynthetic pathways are
                  dimers. As a consequence the arginine repressor binds to two
                  palindromic sites rather than to one. It was found that the
                  arginine repressor not only acts in the repression of enzyme
                  synthesis but also is required for the resolution of plasmid
                  multimers to monomers, a completely unrelated
                  function. Finally, the arginine repressor does not possess
                  characteristic structural features seen in other prokaryotic
                  repressors, such as a helix-turn-helix motif or an
                  antiparallel beta-sheet motif. The unique features have
                  sustained continuous interest in the arginine repressor and
                  have made it a challenging subject of investigation.}

   Abstract={In Bacillus subtilis, the AhrC protein represses genes encoding
                  enzymes of arginine biosynthesis and activates those mediating
                  its catabolism. To determine how this repressor also functions
                  as an activator, we attempted to clone catabolic genes by
                  searching for insertions of the Tn917-lacZ transposon that
                  express AhrC-dependent, arginine-inducible beta-galactosidase
                  activity. One such isolate was obtained. The region upstream
                  of lacZ was subcloned in Escherichia coli in such a way that
                  it could be replaced in the B. subtilis chromosome after
                  appropriate manipulation. Analysis of exonuclease III-derived
                  deletions located an AhrC-dependent, arginine-inducible
                  promoter to within a ca. 1.9 kb fragment. The sequence
                  revealed: the 3' end of an ORF homologous to gdh genes
                  encoding glutamate dehydrogenase, with highest homology to the
                  homologue from Clostridium difficile; the 5' end of an ORF
                  homologous to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding delta
                  1-pyrroline 5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH), an enzyme of
                  arginine catabolism; and just upstream of the latter, a
                  sequence with homology to known AhrC binding sites in the
                  upstream part of the biosynthetic argCJBD-cpa-F cluster. The
                  same region has also been sequenced by others as part of the
                  B. subtilis genome sequencing project, revealing that the
                  P5CDH gene is the first in a cluster termed
                  rocABC. Restriction fragments containing the putative
                  AhrC-binding sequence, but not those lacking it, showed
                  retarded electrophoretic mobility in the presence of purified
                  AhrC. A 277 bp AhrC-binding fragment also showed anomalous
                  mobility in the absence of AhrC, consistent with its being
                  intrinsically bent. DNAse I footprinting localized AhrC
                  binding to bp -16/-22 to +1 (the transcription
                  startpoint). Such a location for an activator binding site,
                  i.e. overlapping the transcription start, is unusual.}

   Abstract={Recently, the DinR protein was established as the cellular
                  repressor of the SOS response in the bacterium Bacillus
                  subtilis. It is believed that DinR functions as the repressor
                  by binding to a consensus sequence located in the promoter
                  region of each SOS gene. The binding site for DinR is believed
                  to be synonymous with the formerly identified Cheo box, a
                  region of 12 bp displaying dyad symmetry
                  (GAAC-N4-GTTC). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed
                  that highly purified DinR does bind to such sites located
                  upstream of the dinA, dinB, dinC, and dinR genes. Furthermore,
                  detailed mutational analysis of the B. subtilis recA operator
                  indicates that some nucleotides are more important than others
                  for maintaining efficient DinR binding. For example,
                  nucleotide substitutions immediately 5' and 3' of the Cheo box
                  as well as those in the N4 region appear to affect DinR
                  binding. This data, combined with computational analyses of
                  potential binding sites in other gram-positive organisms,
                  yields a new consensus (DinR box) of 5'-CGAACRNRYGTTYC-3'. DNA
                  footprint analysis of the B. subtilis dinR and recA DinR boxes
                  revealed that the DinR box is centrally located within a DNA
                  region of 31 bp that is protected from hydroxyl radical
                  cleavage in the presence of DinR. Furthermore, while DinR is
                  predominantly monomeric in solution, it apparently binds to
                  the DinR box in a dimeric state.}

   Abstract={Repressors, polymerases, ribosomes and other macromolecules bind to
                  specific nucleic acid sequences. They can find a binding site
                  only if the sequence has a recognizable pattern. We define a
                  measure of the information (R sequence) in the sequence
                  patterns at binding sites. It allows one to investigate how
                  information is distributed across the sites and to compare one
                  site to another. One can also calculate the amount of
                  information (R frequency) that would be required to locate the
                  sites, given that they occur with some frequency in the
                  genome. Several Escherichia coli binding sites were analyzed
                  using these two independent empirical measurements. The two
                  amounts of information are similar for most of the sites we
                  analyzed. In contrast, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase binding
                  sites contain about twice as much information as is necessary
                  for recognition by the T7 polymerase, suggesting that a second
                  protein may bind at T7 promoters. The extra information can be
                  accounted for by a strong symmetry element found at the T7
                  promoters. This element may be an operator. If this model is
                  correct, these promoters and operators do not share much
                  information. The comparisons between R sequence and R
                  frequency suggest that the information at binding sites is
                  just sufficient for the sites to be distinguished from the
                  rest of the genome.}

   Abstract={An important step in unravelling the transcriptional regulatory
                  network of an organism is to identify, for each transcription
                  factor, all of its DNA binding sites. Several approaches are
                  commonly used in searching for a transcription factor's
                  binding sites, including consensus sequences and
                  position-specific scoring matrices. In addition, methods that
                  compute the average number of nucleotide matches between a
                  putative site and all known sites can be employed. Such basic
                  approaches can all be naturally extended by incorporating
                  pairwise nucleotide dependencies and per-position information
                  content. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of these
                  basic approaches and their extensions in finding binding sites
                  for a transcription factor of interest without erroneously
                  identifying other genomic sequences.\\ In cross-validation
                  testing on a dataset of Escherichia coli transcription factors
                  and their binding sites, we show that there are statistically
                  significant differences in how well various methods identify
                  transcription factor binding sites. The use of per-position
                  information content improves the performance of all basic
                  approaches. Furthermore, including local pairwise nucleotide
                  dependencies within binding site models results in
                  statistically significant performance improvements for
                  approaches based on nucleotide matches. Based on our analysis,
                  the best results when searching for DNA binding sites of a
                  particular transcription factor are obtained by methods that
                  incorporate both information content and local pairwise
                  correlations.\\ The software is available at

                  strain AYE. Interestingly, the latter has even higher
                  catabolic capacities than <italic>A. baylyi</italic> which has
                  already been reported as a very nutritionally versatile
                  organism. This metabolic performance could explain the

                  strains in environments where nutrients are scarce;
                  <italic>iii</italic>) several processes known to play a key
                  role during host infection (biofilm formation, iron uptake,
                  quorum sensing, virulence factors) were either different or
                  absent, the best example of which is iron uptake. Indeed,
                  strain AYE and <italic>A. baylyi</italic> use
                  siderophore-based systems to scavenge iron from the
                  environment whereas strain SDF uses an alternate system
                  similar to the Haem Acquisition System (HAS). Taken together,
                  all these observations suggest that the genome contents of the

                  distinct ecological niches: human (and more largely hospital

                  between translational selection and mutational biases. Current
                  methods for CUB analysis apply heuristics to integrate both
                  components, limiting the depth and scope of CUB analysis as a
                  technique to probe into the evolution and optimization of
                  protein-coding genes. Here we introduce a self-consistent CUB
                  index (scnRCA) that incorporates implicit correction for
                  mutational biases, facilitating exploration of the
                  translational selection component of CUB. We validate this
                  technique using gene expression data and we apply it to a
                  detailed analysis of CUB in the Pseudomonadales. Our results
                  illustrate how the selective enrichment of specific codons
                  among highly expressed genes is preserved in the context of
                  genome-wide shifts in codon frequencies, and how the balance
                  between mutational and translational biases leads to varying
                  definitions of codon optimality. We extend this analysis to
                  other moderate and fast growing bacteria and we provide
                  unified support for the hypothesis that C- and A-ending codons
                  of two-box amino acids, and the U-ending codons of four-box
                  amino acids, are systematically enriched among highly
                  expressed genes across bacteria. The use of an unbiased
                  estimator of CUB allows us to report for the first time that
                  the signature of translational selection is strongly conserved
                  in the Pseudomonadales in spite of drastic changes in genome
                  composition, and extends well beyond the core set of highly
                  optimized genes in each genome. We generalize these results to
                  other moderate and fast growing bacteria, hinting at selection
                  for a universal pattern of gene expression that is conserved
                  and detectable in conserved patterns of codon usage bias.},

abstract ={Motivation:The interaction between transcription factor (TF) and
                  transcription factor binding site (TFBS) is essential for gene
                  regulation. Mutation in either the TF or the TFBS may weaken
                  their interaction and thus result in abnormalities. To
                  maintain such vital interaction, a mutation in one of the
                  interacting partners might be compensated by a corresponding
                  mutation in its binding partner during the course of
                  evolution. Confirming this co-evolutionary relationship will
                  guide us in designing protein sequences to target a specific
                  DNA sequence or in predicting TFBS for poorly studied
                  proteins, or even correcting and rescuing disease mutations in
                  clinical applications.Results: Based on six, publicly
                  available, experimentally validated TF–TFBS binding datasets
                  for the basic Helix–Loop–Helix (bHLH) family, Homeo family,
                  High-Mobility Group (HMG) family and Transient Receptor
                  Potential channels (TRP) family, we showed that the evolutions
                  of the TFs and their TFBSs are significantly correlated across
                  eukaryotes. We further developed a mutual information-based
                  method to identify co-evolved protein residues and DNA
                  bases. This research sheds light on the dynamic relationship
                  between TF and TFBS during their evolution. The same principle
                  and strategy can be applied to co-evolutionary studies on
                  protein–DNA interactions in other protein
                  families.Availability: All the datasets, scripts and other

abstract = "The structure of complex transcriptional regulatory networks has
                  been studied extensively in certain model organisms. However,
                  the evolutionary dynamics of these networks across organisms,
                  which would reveal important principles of adaptive regulatory
                  changes, are poorly understood. We use the known
                  transcriptional regulatory network of Escherichia coli to
                  analyse the conservation patterns of this network across 175
                  prokaryotic genomes, and predict components of the regulatory
                  networks for these organisms. We observe that transcription
                  factors are typically less conserved than their target genes
                  and evolve independently of them, with different organisms
                  evolving distinct repertoires of transcription factors
                  responding to specific signals. We show that prokaryotic
                  transcriptional regulatory networks have evolved principally
                  through widespread tinkering of transcriptional interactions
                  at the local level by embedding orthologous genes in different
                  types of regulatory motifs. Different transcription factors
                  have emerged independently as dominant regulatory hubs in
                  various organisms, suggesting that they have convergently
                  acquired similar network structures approximating a scale-free
                  topology. We note that organisms with similar lifestyles
                  across a wide phylogenetic range tend to conserve equivalent
                  interactions and network motifs. Thus, organism-specific
                  optimal network designs appear to have evolved due to
                  selection for specific transcription factors and
                  transcriptional interactions, allowing responses to prevalent
                  environmental stimuli. The methods for biological network
                  analysis introduced here can be applied generally to study
                  other networks, and these predictions can be used to guide
                  specific experiments. "

                  BLAST hits (BBHs), are evolutionary orthologs with conserved

abstract ={Over millions of years the structure and complexity of the
                  transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) in bacteria has
                  changed, reorganized and enabled them to adapt to almost every
                  environmental niche on earth. In order to understand the
                  plasticity of TRNs in bacteria, we studied the conservation of
                  currently known TRNs of the two model organisms Escherichia
                  coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis across complete genomes
                  including Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya at three different
                  levels: individual components of the TRN, pairs of
                  interactions and regulons. We found that transcription factors
                  (TFs) evolve much faster than the target genes (TGs) across
                  phyla. We show that global regulators are poorly conserved
                  across the phylogenetic spectrum and hence TFs could be the
                  major players responsible for the plasticity and evolvability
                  of the TRNs. We also found that there is only a small fraction
                  of significantly conserved transcriptional regulatory
                  interactions among different phyla of bacteria and that there
                  is no constraint on the elements of the interaction to
                  co-evolve. Finally our results suggest that majority of the
                  regulons in bacteria are rapidly lost implying a high-order
                  flexibility in the TRNs. We hypothesize that during the
                  divergence of bacteria certain essential cellular processes
                  like the synthesis of arginine, biotine and ribose, transport
                  of amino acids and iron, availability of phosphate,
                  replication process and the SOS response are well conserved in
                  evolution. From our comparative analysis, it is possible to
                  infer that transcriptional regulation is more flexible than
                  the genetic component of the organisms and its complexity and
                  structure plays an important role in the phenotypic

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Differences in the transcription regulation network are
                  at the root of much of the phenotypic variation observed among
                  organisms. These differences may be achieved either by
                  changing the repertoire of regulators and/or their targets, or
                  by rewiring the network. Following these changes and studying
                  their logic is crucial for understanding the evolution of
                  regulatory networks.RESULTS:We use the well characterized
                  transcription regulatory network of Escherichia coli K12 and
                  follow the evolutionary changes in the repertoire of
                  regulators and their targets across a large number of fully
                  sequenced gamma-proteobacteria. By focusing on close relatives
                  of E. coli K12, we study the dynamics of the evolution of
                  transcription regulation across a relatively short
                  evolutionary timescale. We show significant differences in the
                  evolution of repressors and activators. Repressors are only
                  lost from a genome once their targets have themselves been
                  lost, or once the network has significantly rewired. In
                  contrast, activators are often lost even when their targets
                  remain in the genome. As a result, E. coli K12 repressors that
                  regulate many targets are rarely absent from organisms that
                  are closely related to E. coli K12, while activators with a
                  similar number of targets are often absent in these
                  organisms.CONCLUSION:We demonstrate that the mode of
                  regulation exerted by transcription factors has a strong
                  effect on their evolution. Repressors co-evolve tightly with
                  their target genes. In contrast, activators can be lost
                  independently of their targets. In fact, loss of an activator
                  can lead to efficient shutdown of an unnecessary pathway.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Integrons are found in hundreds of environmental
                  bacterial species, but are mainly known as the agents
                  responsible for the capture and spread of
                  antibiotic-resistance determinants between Gram-negative
                  pathogens. The SOS response is a regulatory network under
                  control of the repressor protein LexA targeted at addressing
                  DNA damage, thus promoting genetic variation in times of
                  stress. We recently reported a direct link between the SOS
                  response and the expression of integron integrases in Vibrio
                  cholerae and a plasmid-borne class 1 mobile integron. SOS
                  regulation enhances cassette swapping and capture in stressful
                  conditions, while freezing the integron in steady
                  environments. We conducted a systematic study of available
                  integron integrase promoter sequences to analyze the extent of
                  this relationship across the Bacteria domain.RESULTS:Our
                  results showed that LexA controls the expression of a large
                  fraction of integron integrases by binding to Escherichia
                  coli-like LexA binding sites. In addition, the results provide
                  experimental validation of LexA control of the integrase gene
                  for another Vibrio chromosomal integron and for a
                  multiresistance plasmid harboring two integrons. There was a
                  significant correlation between lack of LexA control and
                  predicted inactivation of integrase genes, even though
                  experimental evidence also indicates that LexA regulation may
                  be lost to enhance expression of integron
                  cassettes.CONCLUSIONS:Ancestral-state reconstruction on an
                  integron integrase phylogeny led us to conclude that the
                  ancestral integron was already regulated by LexA. The data
                  also indicated that SOS regulation has been actively preserved
                  in mobile integrons and large chromosomal integrons,
                  suggesting that unregulated integrase activity is selected
                  against. Nonetheless, additional adaptations have probably
                  arisen to cope with unregulated integrase
                  activity. Identifying them may be fundamental in deciphering
                  the uneven distribution of integrons in the Bacteria domain.},

   Abstract={The availability of completely sequenced genomes and the wealth of
                  literature on gene regulation have enabled researchers to
                  model the transcriptional regulation system of some organisms
                  in the form of a network. In order to reconstruct such
                  networks in non-model organisms, three principal approaches
                  have been taken. First, one can transfer the interactions
                  between homologous components from a model organism to the
                  organism of interest. Second, microarray experiments can be
                  used to detect patterns in gene expression that stem from
                  regulatory interactions. Finally, knowledge of experimentally
                  characterized transcription factor binding sites can be used
                  to analyze the promoter sequences in a genome in order to
                  identify potential binding sites. In this chapter, we will
                  focus in detail on the first approach and describe methods to
                  reconstruct and analyze the transcriptional regulatory
                  networks of uncharacterized organisms by using a known
                  regulatory network as a template.}

                  sequence patterns that occur in the DNA or protein sequences
                  provided by the user. Users can perform MEME searches via the
                  web server hosted by the National Biomedical Computation
                  Resource (http://meme.nbcr.net) and several mirror
                  sites. Through the same web server, users can also access the
                  Motif Alignment and Search Tool to search sequence databases
                  for matches to motifs encoded in several popular formats. By
                  clicking on buttons in the MEME output, users can compare the

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Our current understanding of transcription factor binding
                  sites (TFBSs) in sequenced prokaryotic genomes is very limited due
                  to the lack of an accurate and efficient computational method for
                  the prediction of TFBSs at a genome scale. In an attempt to change
                  this situation, we have recently developed a comparative genomics
                  based algorithm called GLECLUBS for de novo genome-wide prediction
                  of TFBSs in a target genome. Although GLECLUBS has achieved rather
                  high prediction accuracy of TFBSs in a target genome, it is still
                  not efficient enough to be applied to all the sequenced prokaryotic
                  genomes.RESULTS:Here, we designed a new algorithm based on GLECLUBS
                  called extended GLECLUBS (eGLECLUBS) for simultaneous prediction of
                  TFBSs in a group of related prokaryotic genomes. When tested on a
                  group of gamma-proteobacterial genomes including E. coli K12, a
                  group of firmicutes genomes including B. subtilis and a group of
                  cyanobacterial genomes using the same parameter settings, eGLECLUBS
                  predicts more than 82% of known TFBSs in extracted inter-operonic
                  sequences in both E. coli K12 and B. subtilis. Because each genome
                  in a group is equally treated, it is highly likely that similar
                  prediction accuracy has been achieved for each genome in the
                  group.CONCLUSIONS:We have developed a new algorithm for genome-wide
                  de novo prediction of TFBSs in a group of related prokaryotic
                  genomes. The algorithm has achieved the same level of accuracy and
                  robustness as its predecessor GLECLUBS, but can work on dozens of
                  genomes at the same time.},

                  a particular regulon across diverse taxonomic lineages; (ii) sets

                  reconstruction for a known regulatory motif and (ii) ab initio
                  inference of a novel regulon using several scenarios for the
                  generation of starting gene sets. RegPredict provides a
                  comprehensive collection of manually curated positional weight
                  matrices of regulatory motifs. It is based on genomic sequences,
                  ortholog and operon predictions from the MicrobesOnline. An
                  interactive web interface of RegPredict integrates and presents
                  diverse genomic and functional information about the candidate
                  regulon members from several web resources. RegPredict is freely
                  accessible at http://regpredict.lbl.gov.},

abstract ={This article summarizes our progress with RegulonDB
                  (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/) during the past 2 years. We have
                  kept up-to-date the knowledge from the published literature
                  regarding transcriptional regulation in Escherichia coli K-12. We
                  have maintained and expanded our curation efforts to improve the
                  breadth and quality of the encoded experimental knowledge, and we
                  have implemented criteria for the quality of our computational
                  predictions. Regulatory phrases now provide high-level descriptions
                  of regulatory regions. We expanded the assignment of quality to
                  various sources of evidence, particularly for knowledge generated
                  through high-throughput (HT) technology. Based on our analysis of
                  most relevant methods, we defined rules for determining the quality
                  of evidence when multiple independent sources support an
                  entry. With this latest release of RegulonDB, we present a new
                  highly reliable larger collection of transcription start sites, a
                  result of our experimental HT genome-wide efforts. These
                  improvements, together with several novel enhancements (the tracks
                  display, uploading format and curational guidelines), address the
                  challenges of incorporating HT-generated knowledge into
                  RegulonDB. Information on the evolutionary conservation of
                  regulatory elements is also available now. Altogether, RegulonDB
                  version 8.0 is a much better home for integrating knowledge on gene
                  regulation from the sources of information currently available.},

abstract ={DBTBS (http://dbtbs.hgc.jp) was originally released in 1999 as a reference
                  database of published transcriptional regulation events in Bacillus
                  subtilis, one of the best studied bacteria. It is essentially a
                  compilation of transcription factors with their regulated genes as
                  well as their recognition sequences, which were experimentally
                  characterized and reported in the literature. Here we report its
                  major update, which contains information on 114 transcription
                  factors, including sigma factors, and 633 promoters of 525
                  genes. The number of references cited in the database has increased
                  from 291 to 378. It also supports a function to find putative
                  transcription factor binding sites within input sequences by using
                  our collection of weight matrices and consensus
                  patterns. Furthermore, though preliminarily, DBTBS now aims to
                  contribute to comparative genomics by showing the presence or
                  absence of potentially orthologous transcription factors and their
                  corresponding cis‐elements on the promoters of their potentially
                  orthologously regulated genes in 50 eubacterial genomes.},

                  with their target sites pose new challenges for TF-binding site
                  databases. CollecTF (http://collectf.umbc.edu) compiles data on
                  experimentally validated, naturally occurring TF-binding sites
                  across the Bacteria domain, placing a strong emphasis on the

                  of the stored data and fully customizable access to its

                  and openly, allowing users to dynamically redefine binding motifs
                  and their experimental support base. Data quality and currency are
                  fostered in CollecTF by adopting a sustainable model that
                  encourages direct author submissions in combination with in-house
                  validation and curation of published literature. CollecTF entries
                  are periodically submitted to NCBI for integration into RefSeq

                  from 150 in the initial version of DBD to over 700 in the
                  current version. All predicted TFs must contain a significant

                  and prokaryotes. Eukaryotes follow a slower rate of increase

abstract ={STAMP is a newly developed web server that is designed to support the
                  study of DNA-binding motifs. STAMP may be used to query motifs
                  against databases of known motifs; the software aligns input
                  motifs against the chosen database (or alternatively against a
                  user-provided dataset), and lists of the highest-scoring
                  matches are returned. Such similarity-search functionality is
                  expected to facilitate the identification of transcription
                  factors that potentially interact with newly discovered
                  motifs. STAMP also automatically builds multiple alignments,
                  familial binding profiles and similarity trees when more than
                  one motif is inputted. These functions are expected to enable
                  evolutionary studies on sets of related motifs and fixed-order
                  regulatory modules, as well as illustrating similarities and
                  redundancies within the input motif collection. STAMP is a
                  highly flexible alignment platform, allowing users to
                  ‘mix-and-match’ between various implemented comparison
                  metrics, alignment methods (local or global, gapped or
                  ungapped), multiple alignment strategies and tree-building
                  methods. Motifs may be inputted as frequency matrices (in many
                  of the commonly used formats), consensus sequences, or
                  alignments of known binding sites. STAMP also directly accepts
                  the output files from 12 supported motif-finders, enabling
                  quick interpretation of motif-discovery analyses. STAMP is
                  available at http://www.benoslab.pitt.edu/stamp},

                  that DNA was the genetic material it became apparent that
                  organisms, and in particular bacteria, use the four letters of
                  the genetic code to very different extents; the use of G and C
                  varies from less than 20% in some species, to more than 70% in
                  others. This variation in the use of G and C is usually
                  attributed to differences in the pattern of mutation between
                  species. Here we test this hypothesis, and show that, on the
                  contrary, there seems to be pervasive selection on the base
                  composition of the bacterial genome, particularly in GC-rich
                  species. This suggests that many, if not all, sites may be
                  subject to natural selection in many bacteria. Unfortunately,
                  the reason why some bacteria should be selected for high
                  GC-content remains unclear.</p> },

                  the variability generated by mutation and biases evolution
                  toward fitter outcomes. However, because mutation is itself
                  not entirely random it can also bias the direction of
                  evolution independently of selection. For instance, it is
                  often assumed that the extreme variation observed in
                  nucleotide content among bacteria (from ∼20% to ∼80% GC) is
                  predominantly driven by extreme differences in mutational
                  biases towards or away from GC. Here, we show that bacterial
                  lineages that recently developed clonal, pathogenic lifestyles
                  evolve under weak selection and that polymorphisms in these
                  bacteria can be used as a fair proxy for mutational
                  spectra. We analyze large sequence datasets from five clonal
                  pathogens in four diverse bacterial clades spanning most of
                  the range of genomic nucleotide content. We find that,
                  surprisingly, mutation is AT-biased in every case to a very
                  similar degree and in each case it is dominated by transitions
                  from C/G to T/A. This demonstrates that mutational biases are
                  far les variable than previously assumed and that variation in
                  bacterial nucleotide content is not due entirely to mutational
                  biases. Rather natural selection or a selection like process
                  such as biased gene conversion strongly affect nucleotide
                  content in bacteria.</p> },

abstract ={Given the dramatic variation in guanine-cytosine (GC) content
                  observed in prokaryotes, from ∼20% to ∼75% GC, one wonders if
                  these extreme biases in base pair composition affect the
                  evolution of transcription factor–binding sites (BS). This
                  letter shows that, along the wide range of GC content
                  variation in bacteria, bacterial BS keep a high frequency of
                  AT bases, roughly independently of the background (BG) base
                  pair composition of intergenic regions. As a result, the
                  equilibrium base pair frequencies of BS depart the most from
                  those of BS DNA in GC-rich genomes. This not only implies a
                  higher specificity but also a higher coding barrier for BS in
                  GC-rich genomes. In accordance, we observe that the average
                  percentage of divergently transcribed regions increases with
                  the GC content of the genome, suggesting the use of a more
                  efficient coding strategy.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Searching for transcription factor binding sites in
                  genome sequences is still an open problem in
                  bioinformatics. Despite substantial progress, search methods
                  based on information theory remain a standard in the field,
                  even though the full validity of their underlying assumptions
                  has only been tested in artificial settings. Here we use newly
                  available data on transcription factors from different
                  bacterial genomes to make a more thorough assessment of
                  information theory-based search methods.RESULTS:Our results
                  reveal that conventional benchmarking against artificial
                  sequence data leads frequently to overestimation of search
                  efficiency. In addition, we find that sequence information by
                  itself is often inadequate and therefore must be complemented
                  by other cues, such as curvature, in real
                  genomes. Furthermore, results on skewed genomes show that
                  methods integrating skew information, such as Relative
                  Entropy, are not effective because their assumptions may not
                  hold in real genomes. The evidence suggests that binding sites
                  tend to evolve towards genomic skew, rather than against it,
                  and to maintain their information content through increased
                  conservation. Based on these results, we identify several
                  misconceptions on information theory as applied to binding
                  sites, such as negative entropy, and we propose a revised
                  paradigm to explain the observed results.CONCLUSION:We
                  conclude that, among information theory-based methods, the
                  most unassuming search methods perform, on average, better
                  than any other alternatives, since heuristic corrections to
                  these methods are prone to fail when working on real data. A
                  reexamination of information content in binding sites reveals
                  that information content is a compound measure of search and
                  binding affinity requirements, a fact that has important
                  repercussions for our understanding of binding site
                  evolution.},

   Abstract={The similarity of two biological sequences has traditionally been
                  assessed within the well-established framework of
                  alignment. Here we focus on the task of identifying functional
                  relationships between cis-regulatory sequences that are
                  non-orthologous or greatly diverged. 'Alignment-free' measures
                  of sequence similarity are required in this regime.\\ We
                  investigate the use of a new score for alignment-free sequence
                  comparison, called the score. It is based on comparing the
                  frequencies of all fixed-length words in the two sequences. An
                  important, novel feature of the score is that it is comparable
                  across sequence pairs drawn from arbitrary background
                  distributions. We present a method that gives quadratic
                  improvement in the time complexity of calculating the score,
                  over the naïve method. We then evaluate the score on several
                  tissue-specific families of cis-regulatory modules (in
                  Drosophila and human). The new score is highly successful in
                  discriminating functionally related regulatory sequences from
                  unrelated sequence pairs. The performance of the score is
                  compared to five other alignment-free similarity measures, and
                  shown to be consistently superior to all of these measures.\\
                  Our implementation of the score will be made freely available
                  as source code, upon publication of this article, at:

   Abstract={In contrast to the vast majority of the members of the domain
                  Bacteria, several Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas species have two
                  lexA genes, whose products have been shown to recognize
                  different LexA binding motifs, making them an interesting
                  target for studying the interplay between cohabiting LexA
                  regulons in a single species. Here we report an analysis of
                  the genetic composition of the two LexA regulons of
                  Pseudomonas putida KT2440 performed with a genomic
                  microarray. The data obtained indicate that one of the two
                  LexA proteins (LexA1) seems to be in control of the
                  conventional Escherichia coli-like SOS response, while the
                  other LexA protein (LexA2) regulates only its own
                  transcriptional unit, which includes the imuA, imuB, and dnaE2
                  genes, and a gene (PP_3901) from a resident P. putida
                  prophage. Furthermore, PP_3901 is also regulated by LexA1 and
                  is required for DNA damage-mediated induction of several
                  P. putida resident prophage genes. In silico searches
                  suggested that this marked asymmetry in regulon contents also
                  occurs in other Pseudomonas species with two lexA genes, and
                  the implications of this asymmetry in the evolution of the SOS
                  network are discussed.}

                  is found in a wide variety of environments and must monitor
                  and respond to various environmental signals such as the
                  availability of iron, an essential element for bacterial
                  growth. An important regulator of iron homeostasis is Fur
                  (ferric uptake regulator), and here we present the first study
                  of the Fur regulon in DC3000. Using chromatin
                  immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing
                  (ChIP-seq), 312 chromosomal regions were highly enriched by
                  coimmunoprecipitation with a C-terminally tagged Fur

                  which is pathogenic on crucifers and tomato, and P. syringae
                  pv. glycinea PG4180, a soybean pathogen. The COR molecule
                  contains two distinct components, coronafacic acid (CFA) and
                  coronamic acid (CMA), which are intermediates in the COR
                  biosynthetic pathway. In P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000, it is
                  not clear whether corR, which encodes a response regulator,
                  positively regulates CFA and CMA synthesis as it does in
                  P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180. In this study, a corR mutant
                  of P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 was constructed and was shown
                  to be defective in the production of COR, CFA, and
                  CMA. Furthermore, disease severity was greatly reduced in
                  tomato plants inoculated with the corR mutant compared with
                  wild-type P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000. We also showed that a
                  mutation in hrpL, which encodes an alternate RNA polymerase
                  sigma factor (sigmaL) required for the expression of genes
                  encoding components of the type III secretion system,
                  abrogated production of COR in P. syringae pv. tomato
                  DC3000. The presence of a potential hrp box, the recognition
                  site for sigmaL, upstream of corR suggested that corR might be
                  regulated by hrpL. This was confirmed in reverse-transcription
                  polymerase chain reaction experiments showing that the
                  upstream effector gene holPtoAA, which was associated with the
                  hrp box, was cotranscribed with corR. Furthermore, studies
                  also were conducted to investigate whether mutations in corR
                  had effects on the expression of hrpL. The corR mutant of
                  P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 showed both a reduction and
                  delay in the expression of hrpL and was impaired in its
                  ability to elicit a hypersensitive response on Nicotiana
                  benthamiana. A putative CorR-binding site was identified
                  upstream of hrpL, and gel shift studies confirmed the binding
                  of CorR to this region. These results indicate that corR
                  directly impacts the expression of the hrp regulon in
                  P. syringae.}

   Abstract={Pseudomonas putida is a soil microorganism that utilizes aromatic
                  amino acids present in root exudates as a nitrogen source. We
                  have previously shown that the PhhR transcriptional regulator
                  induces phhAB genes encoding a phenylalanine hydroxylase. In
                  this study we show, using microarray assays and promoter
                  fusions, that PhhR is a global regulator responsible for the
                  activation of genes essential for phenylalanine degradation,
                  phenylalanine homeostasis and other genes of unknown
                  function. Recently, it has been shown that phenylalanine
                  catabolism occurs through more than one pathway. One of these
                  possible pathways involves the metabolism of phenylalanine via
                  tyrosine, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, and homogentisate. We
                  identified two genes within this pathway that encode an
                  acyl-CoA transferase involved in the metabolism of
                  acetoacetate. All genes in this pathway were induced in
                  response to phenylalanine in a PhhR-proficient background. The
                  second potential degradative pathway involves the degradation
                  of phenylalanine to produce phenylpyruvate, which seems to be
                  degraded via phenylacetyl-CoA. A number of mutants in the paa
                  genes encoding phenylacetyl-CoA degradation enzymes fail to
                  grow on phenylpyruvate or phenylacetate, further supporting
                  the existence of this second pathway. We found that the PhhR
                  regulon also includes genes involved in the biosynthesis of
                  aromatic amino acids that are repressed in the presence of
                  phenylalanine, suggesting the possibility of feedback at the
                  transcriptional level. In addition, we found that PhhR
                  modulates the level of expression of the
                  broad-substrate-specificity MexEF/OprN efflux pump. Expression
                  from this pump is under the control of mexT gene product
                  because phenylalanine-dependent transcription from the mexE
                  promoter does not occur in a mexT mutant background. These
                  results place PhhR as an important regulator in the control of
                  bacterial responses to aromatic amino acids.}

                  interconnecting polysaccharides, is the most abundant source
                  of organic carbon in the biosphere. Microorganisms that

                  of hydrolytic enzymes that display highly complex molecular
                  architectures. To unravel the intricate repertoire of plant

                  that of the colonic prokaryote Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron,
                  the genome of C. japonicus is predicted to encode a large
                  number of GH43 enzymes, suggesting that the extensive
                  arabinose decorations appended to pectins and xylans may
                  represent a major nutrient source, not just for intestinal
                  bacteria but also for microorganisms that occupy terrestrial
                  ecosystems. The results presented here predict that
                  C. japonicus possesses an extensive range of glycoside
                  hydrolases, lyases, and esterases. Most importantly, the
                  genome of C. japonicus is remarkably similar to that of the
                  gram-negative marine bacterium, Saccharophagus degradans
                  2-40(T). Approximately 50% of the predicted C. japonicus
                  plant-degradative apparatus appears to be shared with
                  S. degradans, consistent with the utilization of plant-derived
                  complex carbohydrates as a major substrate by both organisms.}

   Abstract={Microbial degradation of plant cell walls is a critical contributor
                  to the global carbon cycle, and enzymes derived from microbes
                  play a key role in the sustainable biofuels industry. Despite
                  its biological and biotechnological importance, relatively
                  little is known about how microbes degrade plant cell
                  walls. Much of this gap in knowledge has resulted from
                  difficulties in extending modern molecular tools to the study
                  of plant cell wall-degrading microbes. The bacterium
                  Cellvibrio japonicus has recently emerged as a powerful model
                  system for the study of microbial plant cell wall
                  degradation. C. japonicus is unique among microbial model
                  systems in that it possesses the ability to carry out the
                  complete degradation of plant cell wall
                  polysaccharides. Furthermore, an extensive array of genetic
                  and molecular tools exists for functional genomic analysis. In
                  this review, we describe progress in the development of
                  methodology for the functional genomic study of plant cell
                  wall degradation by this microbe, and discuss future

   Journal="PLoS Comput. Biol.",
   Year="2010",
   Volume="6",
   Number="6",
   Pages="e1000813",
   Month="Jun",
   Abstract={As many as 59\% of the transcription factors in Escherichia coli
                  regulate the transcription rate of their own genes. This
                  suggests that auto-regulation has one or more important
                  functions. Here, one possible function is studied. Often the
                  transcription rate of an auto-regulator is also controlled by
                  additional transcription factors. In these cases, the way the
                  expression of the auto-regulator responds to changes in the
                  concentrations of the "input" regulators (the response
                  function) is obviously affected by the auto-regulation. We
                  suggest that, conversely, auto-regulation may be used to
                  optimize this response function. To test this hypothesis, we
                  use an evolutionary algorithm and a chemical-physical model of
                  transcription regulation to design model cis-regulatory
                  constructs with predefined response functions. In these
                  simulations, auto-regulation can evolve if this provides a
                  functional benefit. When selecting for a series of elementary
                  response functions-Boolean logic gates and linear
                  responses-the cis-regulatory regions resulting from the
                  simulations indeed often exploit
                  auto-regulation. Surprisingly, the resulting constructs use
                  auto-activation rather than auto-repression. Several design
                  principles show up repeatedly in the simulation results. They
                  demonstrate how auto-activation can be used to generate sharp,
                  switch-like activation and repression circuits and how
                  linearly decreasing response functions can be
                  obtained. Auto-repression, on the other hand, resulted only
                  when a high response speed or a suppression of intrinsic noise
                  was also selected for. The results suggest that, while
                  auto-repression may primarily be valuable to improve the
                  dynamical properties of regulatory circuits, auto-activation
                  is likely to evolve even when selection acts on the shape of
                  response function only.}

   Abstract={The assumption of basic properties, like self-regulation, in simple
                  transcriptional regulatory networks can be exploited to infer
                  regulatory motifs from the growing amounts of genomic and
                  meta-genomic data. These motifs can in principle be used to
                  elucidate the nature and scope of transcriptional networks
                  through comparative genomics. Here we assess the feasibility
                  of this approach using the SOS regulatory network of
                  Gram-positive bacteria as a test case. Using experimentally
                  validated data, we show that the known regulatory motif can be
                  inferred through the assumption of
                  self-regulation. Furthermore, the inferred motif provides a
                  more robust search pattern for comparative genomics than the
                  experimental motifs defined in reference organisms. We take
                  advantage of this robustness to generate a functional map of
                  the SOS response in Gram-positive bacteria. Our results reveal
                  definite differences in the composition of the LexA regulon
                  between Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and confirm that
                  regulation of cell-division inhibition is a widespread
                  characteristic of this network among Gram-positive bacteria.}

   Abstract={Recent advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) have
                  enabled tremendous leaps forward in our understanding of
                  bacterial transcriptomes. However, computational methods for
                  analysis of bacterial transcriptome data have not kept pace
                  with the large and growing data sets generated by RNA-seq
                  technology. Here, we present new algorithms, specific to
                  bacterial gene structures and transcriptomes, for analysis of
                  RNA-seq data. The algorithms are implemented in an open source
                  software system called Rockhopper that supports various stages
                  of bacterial RNA-seq data analysis, including aligning
                  sequencing reads to a genome, constructing transcriptome maps,
                  quantifying transcript abundance, testing for differential
                  gene expression, determining operon structures and visualizing
                  results. We demonstrate the performance of Rockhopper using
                  2.1 billion sequenced reads from 75 RNA-seq experiments
                  conducted with Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae,
                  Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pyogenes and Xenorhabdus
                  nematophila. We find that the transcriptome maps generated by
                  our algorithms are highly accurate when compared with focused
                  experimental data from E. coli and N. gonorrhoeae, and we
                  validate our system's ability to identify novel small RNAs,
                  operons and transcription start sites. Our results suggest
                  that Rockhopper can be used for efficient and accurate
                  analysis of bacterial RNA-seq data, and that it can aid with
                  elucidation of bacterial transcriptomes.}
