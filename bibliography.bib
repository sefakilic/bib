abstract ={The database PRODORIC aims to systematically organize information on
                  prokaryotic gene expression, and to integrate this information into
                  regulatory networks. The present version focuses on pathogenic
                  bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PRODORIC links data on
                  environmental stimuli with trans-acting transcription factors,
                  cis-acting promoter elements and regulon definition. Interactive
                  graphical representations of operon, gene and promoter structures
                  including regulator-binding sites, transcriptional and
                  translational start sites, supplemented with information on
                  regulatory proteins are available at varying levels of detail. The
                  data collection provided is based on exhaustive analyses of
                  scientific literature and computational sequence
                  prediction. Included within PRODORIC are tools to define and
                  predict regulator binding sites. It is accessible at

abstract ={This article summarizes our progress with RegulonDB
                  (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/) during the past 2 years. We have
                  kept up-to-date the knowledge from the published literature
                  regarding transcriptional regulation in Escherichia coli K-12. We
                  have maintained and expanded our curation efforts to improve the
                  breadth and quality of the encoded experimental knowledge, and we
                  have implemented criteria for the quality of our computational
                  predictions. Regulatory phrases now provide high-level descriptions
                  of regulatory regions. We expanded the assignment of quality to
                  various sources of evidence, particularly for knowledge generated
                  through high-throughput (HT) technology. Based on our analysis of
                  most relevant methods, we defined rules for determining the quality
                  of evidence when multiple independent sources support an
                  entry. With this latest release of RegulonDB, we present a new
                  highly reliable larger collection of transcription start sites, a
                  result of our experimental HT genome-wide efforts. These
                  improvements, together with several novel enhancements (the tracks
                  display, uploading format and curational guidelines), address the
                  challenges of incorporating HT-generated knowledge into
                  RegulonDB. Information on the evolutionary conservation of
                  regulatory elements is also available now. Altogether, RegulonDB
                  version 8.0 is a much better home for integrating knowledge on gene
                  regulation from the sources of information currently available.},

doi = {10.1093/nar/gkt1123}, 
abstract ={The influx of high-throughput data and the need for complex models to
                  describe the interaction of prokaryotic transcription factors (TF)
                  with their target sites pose new challenges for TF-binding site
                  databases. CollecTF (http://collectf.umbc.edu) compiles data on
                  experimentally validated, naturally occurring TF-binding sites
                  across the Bacteria domain, placing a strong emphasis on the
                  transparency of the curation process, the quality and availability
                  of the stored data and fully customizable access to its
                  records. CollecTF integrates multiple sources of data automatically
                  and openly, allowing users to dynamically redefine binding motifs
                  and their experimental support base. Data quality and currency are
                  fostered in CollecTF by adopting a sustainable model that
                  encourages direct author submissions in combination with in-house
                  validation and curation of published literature. CollecTF entries
                  are periodically submitted to NCBI for integration into RefSeq
                  complete genome records as link-out features, maximizing the
                  visibility of the data and enriching the annotation of RefSeq files
                  with regulatory information. Seeking to facilitate comparative
                  genomics and machine-learning analyses of regulatory interactions,
                  in its initial release CollecTF provides domain-wide coverage of
                  two TF families (LexA and Fur), as well as extensive representation
                  for a clinically important bacterial family, the Vibrionaceae.},
